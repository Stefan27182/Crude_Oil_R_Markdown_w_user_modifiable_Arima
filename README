This folder contains a style sheet for html output,
a folder which contains a Crude Oil weekly prices in a tsv,
and an R Markdown file.

The R Markdown file contains a commented out auto.arima which 
you can uncomment and alter to your preference.

You can run the code chunks as set out, you can modify the chunks, 
and finally you can run knit in RStudio which will save the output 
of all the chunks to an HTML file.
